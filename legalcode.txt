Statement of Purpose

The laws of various jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
confer certain exclusive rights upon the creator of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”), and the subsequent
owners thereof.

Some owners of these exclusive rights wish to permanently remove these
restrictions from a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons
that the public can reliably build upon, modify, reuse and redistribute
as freely as possible from such restrictions for any purposes and in
any form whatsoever, whether modified or unmodified, in whole or in
part. Such owners therefore wish to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish their Copyright Related
Rights (defined below) with respect to a Work to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

A Work associated with this CC0 Waiver may be protected by copyright and
related or neighboring rights, database rights (such as those arising
under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
implementation thereof, (including any amended or successor version of
such directive)), and/or other similar equivalent or corresponding rights
throughout the world as such rights may be available under applicable
law or treaty (and national implementations thereof), including but not
limited to moral rights retained by the original author(s), publicity and
privacy rights pertaining to an individual’s image or likeness depicted
in a Work, rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to the
Work, and any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse
of data in the Work (such rights all, collectively, the “Copyright
Related Rights”).

The person associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work is the owner of
Copyright Related Rights in the Work (the “Affirmer”), and does
openly, overtly and voluntarily elect to apply this CC0 Waiver to his
or her Work with knowledge of his or her Copyright Related Rights in
the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of this CC0 Waiver.

Subject to rights of other persons in the Work, and any patent and
trademark rights held by Affirmer, by associating this CC0 Waiver with
a Work the Affirmer does intend to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish all of his or her Copyright
Related Rights in such Work, to the fullest extent permitted by (but
not in contravention of) applicable law.

CC0 Waiver

1. To the fullest extent permitted by (but not in contravention of)
applicable law, Affirmer hereby fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons and relinquishes all of Affirmer’s
Copyright Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
whether present or future, vested or contingent, in the Work, (such
waiver, abandonment, and relinquishment, the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
the detriment of Affirmer's heirs or successors.

2. Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved
to the maximum extent permitted and Affirmer hereby grants to each
such affected recipient of the Work a worldwide, royalty-free, non
exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright),
non transferable, non sublicensable, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright Related Rights in the Work,
which license shall be deemed effective as of the date this CC0 Waiver
was applied by Affirmer to the Work.

3. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
relinquished, licensed or otherwise affected by this CC0 Waiver.

4. Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility
for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work
or any intended use thereof, including without limitation any such
person’s Copyright Related Rights (including privacy and publicity
rights). Further, Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims
responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
other rights required for such intended use.

5. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
party to this CC0 Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this CC0 Waiver or use of the Work.
